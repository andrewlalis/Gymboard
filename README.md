# Gymboard
Leaderboards for your local community gym.

## Development
Gymboard is comprised of a variety of components, each in its own directory, and with its own project format. Follow the instructions in the README of the respective project to set that one up.

A `docker-compose.yml` file is defined in this directory, and it defines a set of services that may be used by one or more services. Install docker on your system if you haven't already, and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
